# My Password Manager
A simple Password Manager and Password Generator to store your passwords locally, and arguably safer, then on the internet. 

# Features
* Save website, email/usrname, and password to a data.txt file on your computer.
* Generate a strong randomized password
* Automatically copies password to your clipboard when generating, for easy paste.


# Motivation
I wanted to make a password manager that built on an old program I made when I first started coding. The old program was simply a randomized password generator
that ran in the terminal. At the time it was a very daunting and difficult program to make. Part of that code still exists in my new program, but it's only one tiny part 
of a much larger and improved program. I'm still in the early stages of my Programming Journey, and I still have sooo much to learn and improve. However, this was a 
giant milestone for me, and it's extremely motivating to see how much I've learned and improved in just a couple of months. 

# Updates
* Now saves information to a data.json file instead of .txt.
* Search feature, that allows you to search saved entries and auto copies password to clipboard.
